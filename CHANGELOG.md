# Changelog

## [1.1.0] – Cobblemon 1.7.2 Update

### ✨ Added
- Updated compatibility for **Cobblemon 1.7.2**
- Added a **Nether Star crafting recipe** (endgame material)
- Added a **Shulker Shell crafting recipe**
    - Used as an ingredient for **Master Ball crafting**
- Added a **new Shiny Exchange Gem recipe**
    - Requires rarer and more valuable materials
    - Increases the overall value of making Pokémon Shiny

### 🔧 Changed
- **Completely reworked the Shiny Exchange Gem recipe**
    - The old recipe was too easy to obtain, making Shinies feel less valuable
    - The new recipe focuses on late-game progression (Nether / End / Ancient City)
- Improved overall crafting balance to better fit endgame gameplay

### 🎮 Balance
- Shiny Pokémon can no longer be easily mass-produced in mid-game
- Making a Pokémon Shiny now feels like a meaningful late-game achievement
- Master Ball crafting now requires more serious resource investment

### 🧩 Compatibility
- Fully compatible with **Cobblemon 1.7.2**
- Existing worlds are safe (recipe changes only)
